- Usage
    -

    bPlex should work "out of the box" in most cases, as the default allows for automatic server discovery.
    If this doesn't work, then discovery can be switched off, and a manually entered hostname or IP address can be used.

    If you are watching remotely, or on a bandwidth limited network, switch on Transcoding to reduce the media quality
    to one that works best for you.
